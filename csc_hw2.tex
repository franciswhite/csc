\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{a}
The antiplurality rule is characterized by the \textit{discrete distance} and the \textit{unanimous loser} consensus criterion.\\
A candidate $x$ is a \textit{unanimous loser} with respect to some profile iff all voters rank $x$ last in their individual ballot.
\subsection*{b}
\textit{Cindarella-Swap Distance}:\\\
This measure of distance between two profiles - $\boldsymbol{R}$ and $\boldsymbol{R'}$ -  only takes into account swaps from one end of an individual ranking to another. The distance is the minimal number of such extremely-opposed swaps needed to turn $\boldsymbol{R}$ into $\boldsymbol{R'}$ or vice versa.
The antiplurality rule is characterized by the \textit{unanimous winner} consensus criterion and the maximal \textit{Cindarella-Swap Distance}.
\subsection*{c}
Noise Model: Each voter independently ranks the true winner of the antiplurality rule at the $m^{th}$ position with probability $1-\epsilon$. All other candidates occupy other positions with probability $\tfrac{\epsilon}{m-1}$ each.\\
Then a candidate $x$ has maximum likelihood of being the true winner iff $x$ is the antiplurality winner.

\section*{Question 3}
\subsection*{a}
It is impossible to prove the claim that some rule is always strictly the best one to minimize the \textit{average regret}. The \textit{average regret} depends on the specific preference profile one is looking at and there are such profiles where all rules perform identically.\\

\noindent Consider the following situation where $N=\{1,2\}$ and $X=\{A,B\}$ and the preference profile $\boldsymbol{\succ}=(\succ_1,\succ_2)$ is as follows:\\
$\succ_1=(A\succ B)$\\
$\succ_2=(B\succ A)$\\
Any resolute voting rule will either declare $A$ or $B$ the winner. In either case the average regret is equal to $0.5$, for one player will have an individual regret of $0$ while the other has an individual regret of $1$.\\
Thus there is no meaningful sense in which any voting rule generally is the 'best choice' in terms of average regret minimisation; given this specific preference profile they all perform equally well.
\subsection*{b}
No matter which $x\in X$ wins, agent $i$'s preference order is uniformly (and independently from all other agents, I assume) drawn from $m!$ possible such orderings. There are therefore equally many orderings where $x$ occupies the first place, the second place, the third etc. in $\succ_i$. Each place of $x$ in $i$'s order is thus equally probable. Hence, each regret-value - from $m-1$ to $0$ is equally probable; that is, has probabality $\tfrac{1}{m}$. \\
Under this assumption of uniform distribution of individual regret, and as $n$ grows very large, the mean or average of the $n$ individual regret-values will converge to the \textit{average expected regret} by the weak law of large numbers. It will simply be $\tfrac{m-1}{2}$.
