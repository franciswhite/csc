\section{Aim of the Research - Julia}
stanovich's hypothesis\\
normative/descriptive gap

\textbf{Less than 200 words}
\section{Prior Research - Silvan(Lowe, Elicitation)/Julia(Knowledge Model)}
\textbf{comprehensible literature review of the research field, 
converging upon the research questions;  not more than 500 words\\
•Describe the state of affairs in the current research field based on the existing body of literature \\
• Elaborate on the theoretical framework\\
• Clarify how previous research leads to the research questions of the current proposal }

It is often assumed that performance on reasoning task is explained by procedural knowledge, presumably consisting of an interaction of general intelligence and prior experience with similar problems. Factual knowledge plays no role in such explanations. The potential influence of having undergone training in formal symbolic logic as a measu

\section{Key Questions - Silvan}
\textbf{this is the essence of the proposal. Hypotheses should be 
derived from the key question; the relation between theory and research
hypotheses should be clearly specified; not more than 500 words\\
a) Formulate the research questions based on previous research\\
b) Translate the specific research questions into research hypotheses  '\\
\section{Procedure}
 not more than 500 words \\
a) Operationalize the research questions in a clear manner into a 
modeling 
strategy\\
b) Describe the procedures for conducting the research (and collecting
 the data) }
 \section{Intended Results - Julia}
\textbf{clarify what the implication of possible outcomes would be 
(per hypothesis) for the research questions as well as for the theory; not more than 500 words \\
• To what extent can the proposed research provide an answer to the re
search 
questions? \\
• What are the (alternative) interpretations if the results do (not) 
match the expectations?} 
Logical training $\implies$ Better performance on logical task\\
educational strategies\\
expert knowledge paradigm extension
