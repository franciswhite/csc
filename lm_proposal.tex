\section{Aim of the Research - Julia}
The findings of empirical studies on reasoning suggest that people often do not follow classical rules of inference, for instance support ungrounded conclusions or do not know how to properly check validities of rules (references). One of the available explanations of this is proposed by Stanovich, namely: (on the relationship between reasoning and rationality) there is a normative/descriptive gap between the rules of logic and actual human reasoning, as the latter falls short of prescriptive standards, which are themselves subnormal; there is therefore much room for \textbf{improvement by suitable education}.\\ 
\indent This turns out to be problematic, as there is no proper model of what type of knowledge acquisition should be considered here as suitable education? Is it the familiarity with the rules or being accustomed to solving this type of problems? Is there a way to make this determination? \\
\indent The idea which comes to mind to study how experts in this domain, namely logicians,  approach reasoning tasks. The prediction of Stanovich's theory would be that they perform much better. Why should it be the case? Is it the fact that they declaratively know the proper rules of reasoning which makes them better at solving reasoning puzzles or is it the skills (procedural knowledge) which they have obtained throughout their training? Our proposal is to thoroughly study the structure of expert knowledge in logic, and then try to implement this knowledge structure in an ACT-R model. This would be followed by a study in the novice/expert paradigm, thanks to which we could determine the empirical plausibility of the ACT-R model.  \\ %these are 266 words

Expert studies are an established paradigm in science \cite{shaw1990modeling}. A variety of cognitive and non-cognitive tasks have been studied with respect to the differences between novices' and experts' \cite{carter1987processing}\cite{carter1988expert}\cite{peskin1998constructing} \cite{means1985star}. Such studies have at times aided the construction of explicit models to explain expert performance in the respective field. This, in turn, allows precise predictions which can then be subjected to empirical testing.

There is currently no model that explicitly captures the content of expert knowledge in the domain of reasoning. Although there exist models of knowledge in the related field of mathematics \cite{lowe2010skills}, as far as we are aware no such effort has been made for logical reasoning to date. Our modeling of knowledge concerning reasoning is thus novel, albeit related to . 

There exists a series of established practices and methods concerning the \emph{elicitation} of expert knowledge for general domains. To our knowledge, there is no canonical method to systematically inquire into experts' mathematical or reasoning skills. Our acquisition of the knowledge that these experts use to solve their respective problems therefore relies on techniques in other domains, for example, in engineering or industrial management \cite{ford1997expert} \cite{cooke1994varieties}. A good deal of the literature on elicitation methods focuses on the acquisition of knowledge that is to be implemented in so-called \emph{expert systems} - computer applications solving complex problems \cite{shadbolt1995knowledge}. This part of the literature is particularly suitable to us, as are ultimate intention in building a conceptual model of expertise in logical reasoning consist in turning it into one at David Marr's algorithmic level. % \cite{marr}

\section{Key Questions - Silvan}
\textbf{this is the essence of the proposal. Hypotheses should be 
derived from the key question; the relation between theory and research
hypotheses should be clearly specified; not more than 500 words\\
a) Formulate the research questions based on previous research\\
b) Translate the specific research questions into research hypotheses }\\

Is performance on logical reasoning task to be explained by \emph{procedural} knowledge - presumably consisting of an interaction of general intelligence and prior experience with similar problems - or by \emph{factual} knowledge - knowing rules of formal logic?
Related to this issue is the question to what extent the logical reasoning of an individual can improve through suitable training. If it were possible to determine the extent in which performance is aided by declarative knowledge, then the teaching of logical reasoning would certainly benefit. It is thus of interest to determine the influence of expertise in formal symbolic logic on human performance in logical reasoning tasks.

As there is currently no literature on methods and techniques which professional logicians use to tackle logical problems, it is pertinent to inquire into the strategies which experts in the field of formal logic employ to tackle reasoning problems.
